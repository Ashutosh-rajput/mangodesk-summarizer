Ingredients
The recipe requires ingredients for both the chicken marinade and the rice. 
For the marinade: Key ingredients include ½ kg chicken, plain yogurt, ginger garlic paste, salt, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and optional lemon juice. 
For the rice: You will need 2 cups of basmati rice, ghee or oil, a large onion, mint leaves, a green chili, plain yogurt, optional red chili powder, garam masala, water, salt, and optional fried onions and saffron soaked in milk. 
Whole spices: Optional whole spices like bay leaf, green cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, star anise, shahi jeera, and mace can enhance the flavor. 
Instructions
Marinate the chicken: Combine yogurt and spices in a bowl, mix well, and add the chicken with slits. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
Prepare the rice: Rinse and soak basmati rice for 30 minutes. If using saffron, soak it in hot milk.
Cook the chicken: Heat ghee or oil, sauté whole spices, then fry the onion until light brown. Add the marinated chicken and cook until tender. Stir in yogurt, mint, chili, and spices, then spread the chicken in a layer.
Layer and cook the biryani: Spread the drained rice over the chicken. Add hot, salted water. Sprinkle remaining mint, and optionally add fried onions and saffron milk. Cook covered until the rice is done, using either a pot or a pressure cooker.
Rest and serve: Let the biryani rest before gently fluffing and serving in layers with raita or shorba. 
Tips for perfect biryani
Aged basmati rice: Using aged basmati rice helps achieve fluffy grains.
Don't overcook the rice: Cook the rice partially before layering to avoid mushiness.
Marinate well: Marinating the chicken in yogurt and spices for at least 30 minutes enhances flavor.
Seal the pot: A tight seal during cooking is crucial for infusing flavors with steam.
Rest after cooking: Letting the biryani rest allows flavors to meld.
